; To flash the target board with this example, I was able to use

;   $ pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB0
;
; This will fetch all necessary dependencies and flash the target.
; Be sure to change the --upload-port parameter if necessary.

; However, simply trying to build without it floods the screen
; with warnings, and indeed â€” the built firmware does not have

; include/lv_conf.h and give it highest precedence.
